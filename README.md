Blooket is a trivia and review tool that allows educators to level up classroom engagement. It is a gamified learning platform where teachers host games through question sets and students answer on their own devices. This is an assessment-centered tool, specifically formative assessment. There are different characters
that students can use called Blooks! They are purchased from the Market out of packs, and there are really rare ones, too! So, what are you waiting for? Ditch
the old classroom review games and start Blooket!

In this repository, I will give information about Blooket, and also walk you through it as we go!
