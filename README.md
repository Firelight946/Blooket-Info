Blooket is a trivia and review tool that allows educators to level up classroom engagement. It is a gamified learning platform where teachers host games through question sets and students answer on their own devices. This is an assessment-centered tool, specifically formative assessment.

In this repository, I will give information about Blooket, and also walk you through it as we go!
