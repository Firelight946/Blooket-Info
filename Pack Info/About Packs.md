Packs are crates that you can purchase from the Market. They each give their own corresponding Blooks based on the Blooks' rarity when opened.
Each pack has a different design, featuring some Blooks. There are seasonal/One Day Only Packs, so make sure you stop by the market occasionally, because you
don't want to miss out on those!
