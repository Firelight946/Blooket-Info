Tower Defense is a game mode in Blooket where you answer questions, build towers, and design your defense to protect yourself from waves of evil blooks.
It gets more difficult as you clear more rounds by adding more and stronger enemies. Tower Defense can be played on different maps: Sunny Meadow, Lost Desert,
and Abandoned Mine.
